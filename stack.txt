# Flutter Backend Template Architecture

## Technology Stack

1. **FastAPI**: Core web framework providing async request handling, automatic OpenAPI documentation, dependency injection, and high performance
2. **SQLAlchemy**: ORM with async support for database interactions
3. **Pydantic**: Data validation and settings management
4. **JWT Authentication**: For secure token-based auth using python-jose
5. **AI Integration**: OpenAI, Hugging Face Transformers, and statistical libraries
6. **Testing**: Pytest for unit and integration tests
7. **Database**: Support for SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL with async drivers

## Architectural Patterns

### Clean Architecture

The project follows a clean architecture approach with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Domain Layer**: Core business logic in models and services
2. **Application Layer**: API routes, controllers, and use cases
3. **Infrastructure Layer**: Database interactions, external services

### Repository Pattern

Database interactions are abstracted through repositories, allowing for:
- Easy switching between different database engines
- Clean separation between business logic and data access
- Testability through mocking repositories

### Dependency Injection

FastAPI's dependency injection system is used throughout for:
- Database sessions
- Authentication and permissions
- Service dependencies

## Directory Structure Explained

### `/app`: Main Application Package

- **`/ai`**: AI integration modules
  - **`/llm`**: Large Language Model integrations (OpenAI, etc.)
  - **`/custom_models`**: Custom ML models from Hugging Face, etc.
  - **`/statistical`**: Statistical and traditional ML models

- **`/api`**: API endpoints organized by version
  - **`/v1`**: Version 1 API endpoints
    - **`/endpoints`**: Individual feature endpoints
  - Version structure allows for API evolution without breaking changes

- **`/core`**: Core application functionality
  - Configuration
  - Security (JWT, password hashing)
  - Base functionality used across the application

- **`/db`**: Database-related modules
  - Session management
  - Base model classes
  - Database utilities
  - Migration scripts (Alembic)

- **`/models`**: SQLAlchemy ORM models
  - Database entity definitions
  - Relationships between entities
  - Database constraints

- **`/schemas`**: Pydantic models for:
  - Request validation
  - Response serialization
  - Data transfer objects

- **`/services`**: Business logic services
  - Implementation of use cases
  - Service layer between API and data access

- **`/utils`**: Utility functions and helpers

### `/config`: Configuration Files

- Environment-specific settings
- Logging configuration
- Other global configuration

### `/tests`: Test Suite

- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Fixtures and test utilities

## Authentication Flow

1. User registers via `/api/v1/auth/register` endpoint
2. User logs in via `/api/v1/auth/token` endpoint
3. Server validates credentials and returns JWT token
4. Client includes token in Authorization header for protected endpoints
5. Server validates token and identifies user for each request

## Database Design

- Async SQLAlchemy ORM for all database operations
- Base model with common fields (id, created_at, updated_at)
- Support for multiple database engines through URL configuration
- Automatic table creation on startup

## AI Integration Architecture

### LLM Integration (OpenAI)

- Abstracted through service layer in `/app/ai/llm`
- Configurable models and parameters
- Error handling and rate limiting
- Async API calls for non-blocking operation

### Custom Models (Hugging Face)

- Infrastructure for loading and using custom models
- Pipelines for text, image, and other data processing
- Model caching and optimization

### Statistical Models

- Integration with scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
- Data processing pipelines
- Model training and prediction workflows

## API Versioning Strategy

- URL-based versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/users`)
- Allows multiple versions to coexist
- Clear path for deprecation and migration

## CORS and Security

- Configurable CORS for Flutter and Vite frontends
- JWT token-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Environment-based security settings

## Flutter Integration

- Appropriate CORS headers for web and mobile apps
- JWT authentication ready for Flutter secure storage
- API designed for efficient mobile consumption
- Swagger documentation for easy client generation

## Extensibility Points

1. **New API Endpoints**: 
   - Add new files in `/app/api/v1/endpoints`
   - Update `/app/api/v1/router.py` to include them

2. **New Database Models**:
   - Create model in `/app/models`
   - Add to `__init__.py` exports
   - Create corresponding Pydantic schemas

3. **AI Capabilities**:
   - Add new AI services in appropriate AI subdirectory
   - Create corresponding API endpoints
   - Update schemas for request/response

4. **Database Migrations**:
   - Use Alembic to generate and run migrations
   - Store migration scripts in the project

## Performance Considerations

- Async everything for high throughput
- Connection pooling for database
- Proper indexing on database models
- Lightweight dependencies
- Efficient serialization/deserialization with Pydantic
